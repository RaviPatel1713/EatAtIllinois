## Project Summary - EAT@Illinois

At the University of Illinois, we have lots of food options but there is a lack of resources to show what restaurants and what specific dishes are good. We want to solve this problem by creating a website where students can find restaurants currently open that serve high-quality cuisine. Students can browse the restaurants by various parameters, such as filtering by cuisine, opening/closing time, and viewing and rating the quality and value of individual dishes. This is useful because students can easily find food they like late at night, which can be difficult since many restaurants close by 9PM or earlier. This is somewhat similar to Yelp or Google Maps, because students can see restaurants and reviews, but different because it is focused on our community and individual dishes can be ranked. The data for restaurant names and locatiojns can be acquired from Google Maps, and the reviews and purchase data can come from student input.
